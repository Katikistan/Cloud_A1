# DCR explaination 
The process is very linear, but for most activities another activity has to have been performed, thatâ€™s why we use condition-arrows. Diagnosing is pending, since the doctor only needs to diagnose the patient if vital signs are abnormal. Therefore for "diagnose the patient" we have added an include-arrow. Take treatment is also pending since a patient can choose to refuse treatment (habeas corpus), therefore we have included an exclude-arrow between "take treatment" and "refuses treatment". All activities are assigned to a role.
